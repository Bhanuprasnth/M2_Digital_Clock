# M2_DIGITAL_CLOCK
# Abstract
Digital time clock counts hours, minutes, seconds, digitally. The objective of this project is construct a device that will display the time in seconds, minutes and hours. In addition to this, it will also display time. We can also set the time using the switch.
# REQUIREMENTS
# Introduction
A digital clock is a type of clock that displays the time digitally as opposed to an analogue clock.

# Features

1. Displays Time in hours and Minutes.

2. Should not get reset when turned off.

3. Should be able to macth the timezones as required.

## 4W and 1H

**What** - A digital clock to see current time.

**Why** - To get to know about electric circuits better.

**When** - Whenever needed, one should be able to see the time.

**Where** - Wherever he is.

 --------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 **How** - By using Atmega328 microcontroller and SimulIDE.
 
 ## SWOT ANALYSIS
**Strengths** 
- Real time time display.
- Able to Reset the time. 
- Can adjust hours and minutes according to ones needs.

**Weakness**
- Not able to Load Seconds.
- It's Very common.

**Opportunities**

- Can add Alarm
- Can add temperature sensor.

**Threats**
- Lack of technology.
- Can get broken easily.
